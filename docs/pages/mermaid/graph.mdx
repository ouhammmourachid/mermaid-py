# Graph module

This module provides the `Graph` base class for creating and manipulating different types of diagrams such as flowcharts, ER diagrams, etc.

## Classes

### Graph

Represents a base class for different types of diagrams.

#### Attributes

- `title` (str): The title of the diagram.
- `script` (str): The main script to create the diagram.

#### Methods

- `save(path: Optional[Path] = None) -> None`: Saves the diagram to a file. If `path` is not provided, the diagram will be saved in the current directory with the title as the filename. The file extension must be either `.mmd` or `.mermaid`.
- `_build_script() -> None`: Builds the script for the diagram by adding a YAML front matter with the title.

## How to Use

To use the `Graph` class, follow these steps:

1. create a Graph object :

```python
from mermaid.graph import Graph

graph = Graph(
    title='simple graph',
    script="""
        flowchart TD
            A[Christmas] -->|Get money| B(Go shopping)
            B --> C{Let me think}
            C -->|One| D[Laptop]
            C -->|Two| E[iPhone]
            C -->|Three| F[fa:fa-car Car]
        """
)

graph # render the graph in notebook
```
the result will be

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Christmas] -->|Get money| B(Go shopping)
    B --> C{Let me think}
    C -->|One| D[Laptop]
    C -->|Two| E[iPhone]
    C -->|Three| F[fa:fa-car Car]
```

2. save the graph in file :

```python
from mermaid.graph import Graph

graph = Graph(...)

graph.save() # save without a path
graph.save('/path/to/file.mmd') # using Path

```

- `save()` with a path will create a file in working directory and the file name will be the `graph.title`.
- `save(...)` with path will check if the path and the file name is valid (ends with `.mmd` or `.mermaid`) and create the file.
